# Web Scraper for University Project

As a group project we were to create an 'experience days' website, we needed some experiences/events to put in our database to use as sample data. So I wrote a quick script in Python to scrape data from their site.

## Requirements:
* Python 3.7.3
* Beautiful Soup
