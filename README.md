# Web Scraper for University Project

As a group project we were to create an 'experience days' website, we needed some experiences/events to put in our database to use as sample data. So I wrote a quick script in Python to scrape data from their site. Data is formatted in JSON, a reference is saved to image and image is also saved.

Website being scraped: https://www.virginexperiencedays.co.uk/

## Requirements:
* Python 3.7.3
* Beautiful Soup
